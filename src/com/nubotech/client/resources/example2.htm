<h1>La Marseillaise - English lyrics</h1>

<span class="english">
<p class="noindent">Arise children of the fatherland<br>
The day of glory has arrived<br>
Against us tyranny's<br>
Bloody standard is raised<br>
Listen to the sound in the fields<br>
The howling of these fearsome soldiers<br>
They are coming into our midst<br>
To cut the throats of your sons and consorts</p>

<p class="chorus"><em>To arms citizens Form your battalions<br>
March, march<br>
Let impure blood<br>
Water our furrows</em></p>

<p class="noindent">What do they want this horde of slaves<br>
Of traitors and conspiratorial kings?<br>
For whom these vile chains<br>
These long-prepared irons?<br>
Frenchmen, for us, ah! What outrage<br>
What methods must be taken?<br>
It is us they dare plan<br>
To return to the old slavery!</p>

<p class="noindent">What! These foreign cohorts!<br>
They would make laws in our courts!<br>
What! These mercenary phalanxes<br>
Would cut down our warrior sons<br>
Good Lord! By chained hands<br>
Our brow would yield under the yoke<br>
The vile despots would have themselves be<br>
The masters of destiny</p>

<p class="noindent">Tremble, tyrants and traitors<br>
The shame of all good men<br>
Tremble! Your parricidal schemes<br>
Will receive their just reward<br>
Against you we are all soldiers<br>
If they fall, our young heros<br>
France will bear new ones<br>
Ready to join the fight against you</p>

<p class="noindent">Frenchmen, as magnanimous warriors<br>
Bear or hold back your blows<br>
Spare these sad victims<br>
That they regret taking up arms against us<br>
But not these bloody despots<br>
These accomplices of Bouill√©<br>
All these tigers who pitilessly<br>
Ripped out their mothers' wombs</p>

<p class="noindent"><a href="/english/carriere.html">We too shall enlist</a><br>
When our elders' time has come<br>
To add to the list of deeds<br>
Inscribed upon their tombs<br>
We are much less jealous of surviving them<br>
Than of sharing their coffins<br>
We shall have the sublime pride<br>
Of avenging or joining them</p>

<p class="noindent">Drive on sacred patriotism<br>
Support our avenging arms<br>
Liberty, cherished liberty<br>
Join the struggle with your defenders<br>
Under our flags, let victory<br>
Hurry to your manly tone<br>
So that in death your enemies<br>
See your triumph and our glory!</p>
